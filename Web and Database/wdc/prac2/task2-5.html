        <h1>A page with some divs and spans </h1>
        <p>This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.</p>

        <span>Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".</span>

        <div>This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.</div>

        <hr>

        <p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span> <span class="fancy"> and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span> because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.</p>


        <p>On the other hand, <span class="bf">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></p>

        <div>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</div>
