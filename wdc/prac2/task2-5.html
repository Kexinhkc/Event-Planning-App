        <h1>A page with some divs and spans </h1>
        <p>This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".</p>
        <p>This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.</p>
        <hr>

        <p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span> <span> and this spanhas a font-family of cursive,</span> because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.</p>
        <hr>

        <p>On the other hand, this span of text is both blue and fancy!</p>
      </div>

        <div>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</div>
